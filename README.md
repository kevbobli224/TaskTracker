# TaskTracker
## Second homebrew homedrink program in C# with Visual Studio
Task Tracking:
1. Create a task
2. Assign your own time limit
3. Assign your own description
4. Save and load task lists

## Todo(Maybe never, lost interest to update):
1. Description and time persists when reopening them instead of reassigning everything
2. Fixing the graphical glitch that persists when you use a custom form base where a visible gap in the program can be clicked through
3. Checkbox to save lists into one file(it is currently saving completed and uncompleted tasks as .json)
4. Sound alert for task completion
