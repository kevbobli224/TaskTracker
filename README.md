# TaskTracker
Second homebrew homedrink program in C# with Visual Studio
Task Tracking:
-Assign your own time limit
-Assign your own description
-Save and load task lists

Todo(Maybe never, lost interest to update):
-Description and time persists when reopening them instead of reassigning everything
-Fixing the graphical glitch that persists when you use a custom form base where a visible gap in the program can be clicked through
-Checkbox to save lists into one file(it is currently saving completed and uncompleted tasks as .json)
-Sound alert for task completion
